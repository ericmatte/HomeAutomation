# Control lights with an RF transmitter

This will show you some reference to build you own RF transmitter in order to controls your lights with your Home Assistant

## Getting Started

For this project, you will need a kit of **433Mhz RF Transmitter With Receiver**. These can be buy online at eBay.
You will also need a kit of outlets switches. I use the **Etekcity Programmable Wireless Remote Control Power Outlet**, which are really not expensive.
